     * so the registry is complete, and it is still early enough for
     * `route:cache` to serialise what it registers.
     *
     * The catch-all in routes/web.php already makes screens reachable; these
     * aliases exist so consumers can write `route('admin.taxonomy')` rather
     * than `route('admin.screen', ['screen' => 'taxonomy'])`.
